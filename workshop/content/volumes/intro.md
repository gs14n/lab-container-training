* Volumes are special directories that are mounted in containers

* Volumes can have many different purposes:

    * share files and directories between containers running on the same machine

    * share files and directories between containers and their host

    * centralize configuration information in Kubernetes and expose it to containers

    * manage credentials and secrets and expose them securely to containers

    * store persistent data for stateful services

    * access storage systems (like Ceph, EBS, NFS, Portworx, and many others)
